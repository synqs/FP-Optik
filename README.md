## How-to make changes

The tutorial is based on [jupyter-books](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html).

Here are the typical steps to make changes:

- clone this repository to your local PC.
- Install jupyter-book through `pip install -U jupyter-book`
- make changes in the appropriate markdown file. They are all located in the `tutorial` folder.
- run `jupyter-book build tutorial` to create the website.
- You can look at your book by opening this file in a browser: *tutorial/\_build/html/index.html*
- Delete the *\_build* directory once you are done with the changes.
- push the changes to the github repo and inform Fred that they are also applied to the website.
